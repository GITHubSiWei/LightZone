Adjusting white balance
=======================

![image](images/Tool-White_Balance-en.png) The **White Balance** tool
allows you to adjust the white balance and tint of your photo to
compensate for a color cast in the light source such as the blue cast of
the sky or tungsten lighting.

**Note:** For raw photos, you should use the Temperature and Tint
sliders of the [Raw Adjustments](Tool-Raw_Adjustments.html) tool
instead.

To adjust the white balance of your photo:
------------------------------------------

1.  Click the white balance tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new white balance tool will appear at
    the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Do either of the following:
    1.  Use the Temperature and Tint sliders to adjust the white balance
        and tint.
    2.  Click the eyedropper button inside the tool (the mouse will
        change to an eyedropper), then click somewhere on your photo
        that you want to be neutral gray. (Your photo's colors will then
        shift accordingly.) When satisfied with the color cast
        reduction, click the eyedropper button again to complete the
        adjustment.

3.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.
