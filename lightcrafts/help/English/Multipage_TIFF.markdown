Multipage TIFF images
=====================

The TIFF image format allows multiple images to be stored in the same
TIFF file. This is typically used to store digitized pages of a
multipage document such as a fax.

To integrate with some other applications, LightZone can save your
edited photos as a two-page TIFF file:

-   The first page is your edited photo along with the LightZone [tool
    stack](Tool_Stack.html) you created.
-   The second page is your original, unedited photo to which the tool
    stack is applied.

Other applications that display multipage TIFF images show the first
page by default. Therefore, the first page is like a full-sized preview
of your edited photo. When the two-page TIFF file is reopened with
LightZone, however, the tool stack is re-applied to your original photo
on the second page and you can resume editing where you left off.

A disadvantage of two-page TIFF files is that they are, of course, twice
as big. Therefore, they are recommended only when integrating with
either [Aperture](Integration-Aperture.html) or
[Lightroom](Integration-Lightroom.html).
