Preferences
===========

LightZone has a handful of user preferences that affect how it operates.
They are described below.

Auto Save
  ~ Ordinarily when you are editing a photo, if you try to edit another
    photo, LightZone will present you with a Save alert asking you
    whether you want to [save your work](Saving.html) before viewing the
    preview image for the other photo. Selecting this option will save
    your work automatically.
Browser Cache
  ~ To operate quickly, LightZone caches thumbnail images of your photos
    in hidden folders on your computer. The hidden folders can either go
    in the same folders as your photos ("local") or all together in one
    location ("global").
Check for Update
  ~ If checked, LightZone will automatically check to see if a new
    software version is available when launched. If a new version is
    available, you will be notified by an alert. Note that your computer
    must have a connection to the internet when LightZone is launched in
    order to check. (If there is no internet connection, the check is
    skipped.)
Copyright Preferences
  ~ These preferences allow you to set default values for the name of
    the artist/photographer and the copyright notice when [editing the
    metadata](Metadata.html) of your photos.
Direct Save
  ~ When checked, using LightZone as the [external editor for another
    application](Workflow_Integration.html) will cause LightZone to save
    your photo directly back to the other application when you select
    File \> Save.
Interactive Rendering
  ~ This controls when your photo is updated while you
    [create](Regions-Creating.html) or [adjust](Regions-Adjusting.html)
    a [region](Regions.html). - **All the time:** Your photo will be
    updated continuously. - **Between Region Changes:** Your photo will
    not be updated until you release the mouse. - **When Regions are
    Done:** Your photo will not be updated until you are done adjusting
    a region (by clicking outside the region, or by pressing either the
    **return** or **esc** (escape) key).
Memory Limit
  ~ This sets the upper limit on the amount of memory that LightZone
    will use. A high limit enables LightZone to operate faster and
    smoother; a low limit leaves more memory available for other
    applications.
Reset LightZone Settings
  ~ Clicking the Reset button will reset LightZone to have its original
    factory settings. This can sometimes resolve some problems you may
    experience. Note that after a reset is performed, LightZone must
    quit.
Scratch Folder
  ~ This is the folder that LightZone will use to store data temporarily
    while you edit your photos. If you have a fast hard disk, using a
    folder on it will enable LightZone to operate faster.
Show Tool Titles
  ~ When checked, the user interface shows titles for the buttons; when
    unchecked, only the buttons themselves are shown.
Save to Folder
  ~ This controls the folder to which your photos are saved whenever
    File \> Save is selected the first time for a photo.
Save LightZone files as
  ~ This controls the format of the image file used when you [save your
    work](Saving.html).
