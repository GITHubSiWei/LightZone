Regions: Adjusting regions
==========================

[4 of 10](Regions-Feathering.html)

The shape of regions in LightZone can be adjusted at any time. When
initially creating regions, you can do a "rough approximation"; then, if
needed, you can go back and adjust them.

To adjust the shape of a region:
--------------------------------

1.  Click the Regions button in the [tool bar](Tools-Controls.html).
    (The region kind buttons will appear to the right of the tool bar
    and the regions for the tool will become visible on your photo.)
2.  ![image](images/Region-Edit.png) Double-click the region whose shape
    you want to adjust. (The control points will become visible.)
3.  Drag a control point until it's in the desired location.
4.  Repeat from step 3 for every control point you want to adjust.
5.  When done, you can either click anywhere outside the region, or
    press either the **return** or **esc** (escape) key.
