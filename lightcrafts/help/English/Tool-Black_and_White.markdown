Black & white conversion
========================

![image](images/Tool-Black_and_White-en.png) The **Black & White** tool
allows you to convert a color photo into a black-and-white photo.

Additionally, you can control the conversion as if a colored filter were
placed in front of the lens when the photo was taken.

**Note:** A filter of a certain color actually filters out its
*complementary* color (the color directly across from it in the color
wheel).

For example, a yellow filter filters out blue light (because blue is
directly across from yellow). Therefore, you can usually increase
contrast in the sky by using a yellow filter because it filters out the
blue of the sky thus making the sky darker compared to clouds.

To convert a color photo to black-and-white:
--------------------------------------------

1.  Click the black & white tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new black & white tool will appear at
    the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  To apply a colored filter, click in the color wheel. (For example,
    clicking somewhere in the yellow part of the color wheel applies
    yellow filter.)
3.  Adjust the Strength slider to increase or decrease the strength (and
    thus effect) of the tool.
4.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.
