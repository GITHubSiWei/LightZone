Regions: Copying regions
========================

[9 of 10](Regions-Deleting.html)

Once created, a region can be copied. This is very useful in a couple of
situations:

-   You want to apply a single tool to multiple areas of your photo that
    have the same shape, for example to blur similarly sized blemishes.
-   You want to apply multiple tools to the same area of your photo, for
    example to increase both the contrast and sharpness of a person's
    eyes.

Additionally, when you paste a region into one tool that has been copied
from another, you can paste it *linked*. If a linked region is moved or
edited, all the regions it is linked to are likewise moved or edited.

To copy and paste a region:
---------------------------

1.  Select the region you want to copy by clicking it. (Its contour will
    change from a solid line to a dashed line.)
2.  Select Edit \> Copy Region.
3.  Select the tool in the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) where you want
    to paste the region.
4.  Select Edit \> Paste Region or Paste Region Linked.
