Regions: Deleting control points
================================

[7 of 10](Regions-Inverting.html)

The shape of regions in LightZone can be adjusted at any time. This
includes deleting control points that are no longer needed.

To delete a control point from a region:
----------------------------------------

1.  Click the Regions button in the [tool bar](Tools-Controls.html).
    (The region kind buttons will appear to the right of the tool bar
    and the regions for the tool will become visible on your photo.)
2.  ![image](images/Region-Delete_Point-en.png) Double-click the region
    that you want to delete a control point from. (The control points
    will become visible.)
3.  Control-click Right-click on the control point you want to delete: a
    menu will pop up.
4.  Select Delete Point.
5.  Repeat from step 3 for every control point you want to delete.
6.  When done, you can either click anywhere outside the region, or
    press either the **return** or **esc** (escape) key.

**Note:** If you have a multi-button mouse, you can alternatively
right-click to pop-up the menu rather than control-click.
