Rotating a photo
================

![image](images/Tool-Rotate-en.png) Sometimes you need to rotate a
photo, for example to make the horizon level. You can use the **Rotate**
tool for this.

Unlike other tools, the rotate tool is special. It is always applied to
the entire photo and is not placed into the [tool
stack](Tool_Stack.html).

To rotate your photo:
---------------------

1.  Click the rotate tool button in the [tool bar](Tools-Controls.html).
    (A white rotate rectangle and grid will appear over your photo and
    the rotate tool's controls will appear to the right of the tool
    bar.)
2.  Click and drag the mouse anywhere on your photo to rotate the
    rectangle so that the grid aligns with something in your photo that
    should be either horizontal or vertical.
3.  Click the arrow button to commit the rotate. (The white rotate
    rectangle and the rotate tool's controls will disappear and your
    photo will be rotated.)

### Notes:

    rotate tool.
