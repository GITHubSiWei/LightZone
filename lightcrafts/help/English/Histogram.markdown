Histogram
=========

[3 of 4](Sampler.html)

![image](images/Histograms.png) Sharing space with the
[ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html), [Color Selection
Viewer](Color_Selection_Viewer.html), and [Sampler](Sampler.html) in the
upper-right corner of the LightZone window is also the histogram that
shows the distribution of intensity for each of the red, green, and blue
color channels.

For example, the histogram in the upper right shows that the photo has
little contrast (because none of the color channels extend into the
darker zones) and is also slightly underexposed (because none of the
color channels extend into the lightest zone).

The histogram in the lower right shows the same photo after both
[exposure](Tool-ZoneMapper-Exposure.html) and [black
point](Tool-ZoneMapper-Black_Point.html) adjustments have been made
using the [ZoneMapper](Tool-ZoneMapper.html) tool. Notice how the color
channels now extend all the way from the darkest zone to the lightest.
