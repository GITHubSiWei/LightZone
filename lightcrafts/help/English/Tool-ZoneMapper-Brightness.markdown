ZoneMapper: Adjusting brightness
================================

[3 of 8](Tool-ZoneMapper-Exposure.html)

One of several adjustments you can make to your photo using the
ZoneMapper tool is brightness.

"Brightness" is what is perceived as the tonal range starting from the
highest highlights down to the midtones. Your photo can be adjusted to
appear brighter without increasing exposure by lifting up the midtones.

To increase the brightness of your photo:
-----------------------------------------

1.  Click the ZoneMapper tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new ZoneMapper tool will appear at the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Move the mouse along the zones in the ZoneMapper to approximately
    the middle zone.
3.  Click between two zones. A *zone lock* will appear (a thin, blue
    line with a little 'X' at its right).
4.  Drag the zone lock upwards. As you do so, your photo will get
    brighter.

5.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

6.  To delete a zone lock, click the little 'X' at its right.

**Note:** To decrease the brightness of you photo, drag the zone lock
downwards rather than upwards.
