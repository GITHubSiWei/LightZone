Metadata
========

![image](images/Metadata-en.png) Metadata is data about a photo, such as
its dimensions and file size, as well as the digital camera used to take
the photo, such as the make and model, lens, ISO setting, and shutter
speed.

Additionally, metadata can also include information about the content of
a photo such as its title, caption, copyright, creator, and location.
(Such metadata is known as IPTC metadata.)

LightZone reads all the metadata for a photo from its image file
automatically. Additionally, LightZone will also read metadata for a
photo from a sidecar XMP file (if present).

On the right side of the browser window is the Metadata Inspector that
shows the selected photo's metadata. You can edit metadata that has a
dark gray background.

To display the metadata for a photo:
------------------------------------

1.  Select the thumbnail of the photo.

To edit the metadata for a photo:
---------------------------------

1.  Click in any metadata that has a dark gray background and type the
    new data. If you have set your [copyright
    preferences](Preferences.html#Preferences-Copyright), you can click
    the small arrow on the right of either the Copyright or Creator
    metadata and the data will be filled in automatically.
