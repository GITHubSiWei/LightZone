Noise reduction
===============

![image](images/Tool-Noise_Reduction-en.png) The **Noise Reduction**
tool allows you to reduce "noise" that is often present in digital
photos as a result of the sensors in digital cameras. The tool reduces
noise in either color or grain (or both).

The initial settings for thr noise reduction tool are good for reducing
the noise introduced by the sensors in digital cameras. If additional
noise is present, for example as the result of a high ISO setting being
used, then you may need to use the sliders to reduce noise further.

**Note:** For raw photos, you should use the Color Noise slider in the
[Raw Adjustments](Tool-Raw_Adjustments.html) tool first. If you want
further noise reduction on only part of your photo, then you can use the
Noise Reduction tool with a [mask](Regions.html).

To reduce the noise of your photo:
----------------------------------

![image](images/Button-Noise_Reduction.png)

1.  Click the noise reduction tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new noise reduction tool will appear at
    the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Use the sliders to adjust the noise reduction effect:
    -   The Color Noise slider controls the amount of color noise
        reduction.
    -   The Grain Noise slider reduces how "grainy" your photo appears.

3.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

**Note:** Noise, and reductions to it, are most easily seen while
looking at a digital photo at the pixel level by selecting View \>
Actual&nbsp;Pixels.
