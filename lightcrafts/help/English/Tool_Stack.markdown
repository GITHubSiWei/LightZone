Tool stack
==========

![image](images/Tool_Stack-en.png) On the lower-right side of the
LightZone window is the tool stack that shows all the tools created for
your photo. The title bar of the selected tool is orange.

When a new tool is created, it is placed on the top of the stack. To
change the ordering of a tool in the tool stack, drag it by its title
bar.

The effect of tools is applied from the bottom of the tool stack to the
top. For example, if there are the
[Hue/Saturation](Tool-Hue_Saturation.html) and [Blur](Tool-Blur.html)
tools in the tool stack, what you see is your original photo modified by
the the Hue/Saturation tool further modified by the the blur tool. This
is illustrated in the figure below.
