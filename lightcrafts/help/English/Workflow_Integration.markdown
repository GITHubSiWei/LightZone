Workflow integration
====================

While LightZone is an all-in-one application for your digital
photography workflow from raw conversion to printing, you can integrate
LightZone into your existing workflow with other applications if you
prefer.

Notably, LightZone saves the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) as part of
your edited photos' metadata. This allows you to edit photos across
multiple sessions each time picking up from where you left off.
