ZoneMapper: Adjusting contrast
==============================

[5 of 8](Tool-ZoneMapper-Black_Point.html)

One of several adjustments you can make to your photo using the
ZoneMapper tool is contrast.

Contrast adjustments using the ZoneMapper tool are performed by
stretching or compressing the luminance range. Before adjusting
contrast, however, you first need to identify the luminance range you
want to adjust. You can use the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html) for this.

To increase the contrast of your photo:
---------------------------------------

1.  Click the ZoneMapper tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new ZoneMapper tool will appear at the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Move the mouse along the zones in the ZoneMapper to locate the zone
    above which you do not want to adjust contrast. (As you move the
    mouse, you can see the zones highlight in the ZoneFinder.)
3.  Click to add a *zone lock* (a thin, blue line with a little 'X' at
    its right).
4.  Similarly, move the mouse along the zones to locate the zone below
    which you do not want to adjust contrast.
5.  Click to add a second zone lock.
6.  Drag the upper zone lock upwards and the lower zone lock downwards.
    As you do so, the contrast of the midtones of your photo will
    increase.

7.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

8.  To delete a zone lock, click the little 'X' at its right.

**Note:** To decrease the contrast of you photo, drag the zone locks
towards each other rather than away from each other.
