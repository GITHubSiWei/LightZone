Styles: Applying
================

[2 of 6](Styles-Creating.html)

Applying a style adds the tools it contains to the top of the [tool
stack](Tool_Stack.html) for either the photo being edited or one or more
photos selected in the [Photo Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html).

To apply a style to the photo being edited:
-------------------------------------------

1.  Select the Styles tab.
2.  Preview a style by moving the mouse over its name. As you do, the
    smaller version of your photo above the styles will show what your
    photo would look like if the style were applied.
3.  To apply the style to your photo, click the name of the style.
4.  Alternatively, if you know exactly which style you want to apply,
    select File \> Apply Style \> and the name of the style that you
    want to apply. (The tools from the style will then be added to the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)

To apply a style to the one or more photos in the browser:
----------------------------------------------------------

1.  Select one or more thumbnails of the photos that you want to apply a
    style to. (Use the Shift key to select multiple, contiguous
    thumbnails or the Command Control key to select multiple,
    non-contiguous thumbnails.)
2.  Select Browser \> Apply Style \> and the name of the style that you
    want to apply. (The tools from the style will then be added to the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) for all the selected
    photos.)
