Inverting masks
===============

[8 of 10](Regions-Copying.html)

Ordinarily, a mask constrains its tool's effect to be inside all of its
[regions](Regions.html). Occasionally, it's useful to be able to use a
mask to specify an area of your photo to *exclude* from a tool's effect.
You can invert a mask to do this.

To invert a mask for a tool:
----------------------------

1.  Select the tool whose mask you want to invert by clicking its title
    bar.
2.  Make sure the Tool Settings tab is selected.
3.  Click the tool's invert-mask box.
