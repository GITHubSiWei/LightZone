Color/Luminosity selection
==========================

![image](images/Tool_Tab-Color_Selection-en.png) Ordinarily, a tool
affects your entire photo. Using a color/luminosity selection, you can
restrict a tool's effect to just a selected hue or luminosity range.

Additionally, color/luminosity selections have adjustable feathering
thus eliminating sharp edges between where a selection is and isn't.

To make a color/luminosity selection:
-------------------------------------

1.  Select the tool that you want to make a color/luminosity selection
    for by clicking its title bar.
2.  Click the [Color Selection
    tab](Tool_Anatomy.html#Tool_Tab-Color_Selection) to reveal the
    color/luminosity selection controls.
3.  Click the eyedropper button. (The mouse will change to an
    eyedropper.)
4.  To select only by hue, uncheck the Enable luminosity checkbox; to
    select only by luminosity, uncheck the Enable hue checkbox.
5.  Click somewhere on your photo that is either the color or luminosity
    you want to select. (The color/luminosity selections as well as the
    [Color Selection Viewer](Color_Selection_Viewer.html) will update to
    reflect the selected color/luminosity.)
6.  Optionally, adjust the Range slider to increase or decrease the
    range of hues selected around the color shown by the color swatch.
7.  Optionally, adjust the Luminosity range sliders to affect the part
    of the selected luminosity range.
8.  To select all colors except the selected color, click the Invert
    checkbox.
9.  If you are satisfied with the color/luminosity selection, click the
    eyedropper button again to complete the selection.
