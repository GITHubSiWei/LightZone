Copying & pasting tools
=======================

You can copy the tools from the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) from one
photo to others using the [thumbnails](Thumbnails.html) of the [Photo
Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html). This is useful when you've taken a set
of photos of the same scene under the same conditions: edit one of the
photos of the set to your liking, then apply those edits to the
remainder of the photos in the set.

### Notes:

-   Copying the tools from a tool stack copies all tools except
    [Crop](Tool-Crop.html), [Proof](Tool-Proof.html), and
    [Rotate](Tool-Rotate.html). Tools' [regions](Regions.html) are also
    copied.

To copy and paste the tools in the tool stack:
----------------------------------------------

1.  Using the [Photo Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html), select the
    thumbnail of the photo you want copy the tools from.
2.  Select Browser \> Copy Tools.
3.  Again using the [Photo Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html), select one or
    more thumbnails of the photos that you want to paste the tools to.
    (Use the Shift key to select multiple, contiguous thumbnails or the
    Command Control key to select multiple, non-contiguous thumbnails.)
4.  Select Browser \> Paste Tools...
5.  A dialog box will appear where you specify how you want the paste to
    be done. If specified, the Batch Label forms part of the new file
    names and is inserted just before the extension.
6.  Click Start. (New LightZone JPEG or TIFF files will be created that
    contain the tools.)
