Regions: Adding control points
==============================

[6 of 10](Regions-Deleting_Point.html)

The shape of regions in LightZone can be adjusted at any time. This
includes adding control points to fine-tune their shape.

To add a control point to a region:
-----------------------------------

1.  Click the Regions button in the [tool bar](Tools-Controls.html).
    (The region kind buttons will appear to the right of the tool bar
    and the regions for the tool will become visible on your photo.)
2.  ![image](images/Region-Add_Point.png) Double-click the region that
    you want to add a control point to. (The control points will become
    visible.)
3.  Click on the contour of the region where you want to add a control
    point: a new control point will be added. You can then drag the new
    control point until it's in the desired location.
4.  Repeat from step 3 for every control point you want to add.
5.  When done, you can either click anywhere outside the region, or
    press either the **return** or **esc** (escape) key.
