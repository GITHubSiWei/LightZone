[1 of 6](Styles-Applying.html)

A *style* is a [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) that was originally created
for one photo that can be applied to other photos. Using styles is the
same as [copying & pasting](Tools-Copy_and_Paste.html) [tool
stacks](Tool_Stack.html) except that a style is saved with a name for
use at any later time.

LightZone comes bundled with many ready-made styles that you can use and
learn from. Additionally, you can create your own styles. Lastly, you
can replace the [default tone curve](Default_Tone_Curve.html) for a
camera with a style you create.
