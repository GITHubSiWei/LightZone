The **Before/After** button toggles the effects of all the tools in the

the tools are applied.

The **Proof** tool allows you to see on screen how your photo will look
when [printed](Printing.html). [More on the proof
tool...](Tool-Proof.html)

The **Zoom** buttons allow you to zoom 1:1, to fit, in, or out to see
more or less detail, respectively.

The **Crop** tool allows you to crop out unwanted parts of your photo.

The **Rotate** tool allows you to rotate your photo, for example to make
the horizon perfectly level. [More on rotating...](Tool-Rotate.html)

The **Regions** button shows or hides all the regions comprising the
mask for the currently selected tool. [More on regions...](Regions.html)
