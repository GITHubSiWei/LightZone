ZoneMapper: Adjusting exposure
==============================

[4 of 8](Tool-ZoneMapper-Contrast.html)

One of several adjustments you can make to your photo using the
ZoneMapper tool is exposure.

To increase the exposure of your photo:
---------------------------------------

1.  Click the ZoneMapper tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new ZoneMapper tool will appear at the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Starting from the first zone, move the mouse downwards along the
    zones in the ZoneMapper until you find a zone that shows significant
    highlighting in the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html).
3.  Click above that zone. A *zone lock* will appear (a thin, blue line
    with a little 'X' at its right).
4.  Drag the zone lock upwards. As you do so, your photo's exposure will
    increase.

5.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

6.  To delete a zone lock, click the little 'X' at its right.
