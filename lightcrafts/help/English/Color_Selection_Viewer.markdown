Color Selection Viewer
======================

[2 of 4](Histogram.html)

Sharing space with the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html),
[Histogram](Histogram.html), and [Sampler](Sampler.html) in the
upper-right corner of the LightZone window is also the Color Selection
Viewer that shows the areas of your photo that are in the selected
tool's [color/luminosity selection](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html).

For example, compare what is shown below.

\(a) no color selected

\(b) blues selected

In (a), no selection has been made so the viewer shows your entire photo
in full color. In (b), the blues have been selected so the areas of the
photo that are blue are shown as white (selected) and the rest is shown
as black (not selected).

To show the Color Selection Preview:
