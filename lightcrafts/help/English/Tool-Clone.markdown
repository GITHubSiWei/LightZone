Cloning areas
=============

![image](images/Tool-Clone-en.png) The **Clone** tool allows you to copy
an area of your photo to another area. This can be used to remove
unwanted items from your photo.

The clone tool is a more general version of the [Spot
tool](Tool-Spot.html).

Unlike other tools, the clone tool is special in that it needs at least
one [region](Regions.html). However, the regions can not be
[inverted](Regions-Inverting.html).

To clone an area of your photo:
-------------------------------

![image](images/Button-Clone.png)

1.  Click the clone tool button in the [tool bar](Tools-Editing.html).
    (A new clone tool will appear at the top of the [tool
    stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Create a [region](Regions.html) around the area that is to be copied
    over.
3.  Click and drag the cross-hair cursor to the center of the area to
    copy from. ![image](images/Clone.png) An area that is the same size
    and shape as the region you created will be copied from around the
    cross-hair cursor to the region you created.
4.  Optionally:
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

**Note:** A single Clone tool can have multiple [regions](Regions.html).
(Each has its own cross-hair cursor.) The advantage of doing this is
that they all share the same [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html),
[opacity](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity), and [color &
luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html) selection.
