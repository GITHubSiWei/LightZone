ZoneMapper: Finding zones
=========================

[2 of 8](Tool-ZoneMapper-Brightness.html)

![image](images/ZoneFinder-Highlighted.png) The ZoneMapper tool works
with the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html): as you move the mouse over the
zones in a ZoneMapper, the corresponding zones in the ZoneFinder
highlight in yellow.

Using a ZoneMapper tool with the ZoneFinder allows you to find zones in
your photo quickly in order to make adjustments.

For example, you can quickly find both the white and black points in
your photo allowing you to [fix the
exposure](Tool-ZoneMapper-Exposure.html) and [get deeper
blacks](Tool-ZoneMapper-Black_Point.html).

To find zones on your photo:
----------------------------

![image](images/Button-ZoneMapper.png)

1.  Click the ZoneMapper tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new ZoneMapper tool will appear at the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Move the mouse over the zones in the ZoneMapper. (As you do so, the
    corresponding zones in the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html) will
    highlight.)
