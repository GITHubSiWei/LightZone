Styles: Creating
================

[3 of 6](Styles-Exporting.html)

Creating a style saves a [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) with a name for
later [application](Styles-Applying.html) to other photos. Additionally,
you can replace the [default tone curve](Default_Tone_Curve.html) for a
camera with a style you create.

To create a style:
------------------

1.  Create a [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) to your liking.
2.  Select File \> Save as Style...
3.  Enter a name for the style.
4.  Enter or select a name for the style's folder. (Styles are grouped
    into folders of your choosing.)
5.  If the photo is a raw image file, there will be a checkbox that, if
    checked, will cause this style to be applied to all raw images from
    the specified camera when opened. This will replace the [default
    tone curve](Default_Tone_Curve.html) for that camera.
6.  Select only those [editing tools](Tools-Editing.html) from the tool
    stack that you want saved as part of the style. (The tools are shown
    in the same order as they are in the tool stack. It's best if you
    [labeled](Tool_Anatomy.html) the tools so each can be easily
    identified.)
7.  Click Save.

**Note:** If you replace the [default tone
curve](Default_Tone_Curve.html) for a camera with your own style, you
can revert to the original default tone curve for the camera by
selecting File \> Reset Style... then the name of the style.
