Raw adjustments
===============

![image](images/Tool-Raw_Adjustments-en.png) The **Raw Adjustments**
tool allows you to adjust various settings of a raw photo. Additionally,
any "hot pixels" that are found are automatically removed.

For raw photos, using the single Raw Adjustments tool yields better
results than if you had used the [ZoneMapper](Tool-ZoneMapper.html) (for
an exposure adjustment), [Noise Reduction](Tool-Noise_Reduction.html),
and [White Balance](Tool-White_Balance.html) tools separately.

Unlike other tools, the Raw Adjustments tool is special. For raw photos,
it is always present at the bottom of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html)
and can neither be disabled nor deleted. Additionally, it is always
applied to the entire photo and can not be masked using
[regions](Regions.html).

To make raw adjustments to your photo:
--------------------------------------

1.  Double-click the title bar of the Raw Adjustments tool to expand it.
2.  Do either of the following:
    1.  Use the sliders to adjust your photo:
        -   The Exposure slider adjusts the exposure. Moving the
            exposure slider to the left (yielding a negative value)
            performs highlight recovery in "blown out" areas of your
            photo.
        -   The Color Noise slider reduces the amount of "noise" that is
            often present in digital photos as a result of the sensors
            in digital cameras.
        -   The Temperature and Tint sliders adjust the temperature and
            tint of your photo to compensate for a color cast in the
            light source such as the blue cast of the sky or tungsten
            lighting.

    2.  Alternatively, click the eyedropper button inside the tool (the
        mouse will change to an eyedropper), then click somewhere on
        your photo that you want to be neutral gray. Your photo's colors
        will then shift accordingly. When satisfied with the raw
        adjustments, click the eyedropper button again to complete the
        adjustment.

3.  To reset the Temperature to its original value, click the As Shot
    button.

**Note:** Noise, and reductions to it, are most easily seen while
looking at a digital photo at the pixel level by selecting View \>
Actual&nbsp;Pixels.
