Converting images
=================

[1 of 2](Converting-Batch.html)

You can convert your photos to either JPEG or TIFF images and in various
sizes suitable for different purposes.

JPEG
  ~ An image format that uses "lossy" compression to achieve small file
    size. It's often used to send photos by e-mail or display photos on
    the web.
TIFF
  ~ An image format that can use "lossless" compression; however, file
    sizes are usually quite large. Despite that, this is usually the
    best format to use for import into other applications.

To convert your photo:
----------------------

1.  Select File \> Convert...

2.  Optionally enter a new name for the converted image.

3.  Select a destination folder for the converted image.

4.  Select the type of image to convert to: JPEG or TIFF.

5.  Select the color profile to include.

6.  Select the [rendering intent](Rendering_Intent.html).

7.  Optionally, check [Black point
    compensation](Black_Point_Compensation.html) (applies only when the
    rendering intent is Relative Colorimetric).

8.  Optionally, enter a width and height in pixels in the Resize To text
    fields to scale down your photo.

9.  Optionally, enter a different resolution and select a unit.

10. Set the quality (for JPEG) or bit depth (for TIFF).

11. Select whether to use LZW compression (TIFF only).

12. Click Convert.
