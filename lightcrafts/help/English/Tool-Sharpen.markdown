Sharpening a photo
==================

![image](images/Tool-Sharpen-en.png) The **Sharpen** tool allows you to
sharpen all or parts of your photo using a technique based on the
tradition of using an unsharp mask in a darkroom to increase the
perception of sharpness by emphasizing edges.

Most digital photos have a slight softness in the fine details and would
benefit from sharpening.

To sharpen your photo:
----------------------

![image](images/Button-Sharpen.png)

1.  Click the sharpen tool button in the [tool bar](Tools-Editing.html).
    (A new sharpen tool will appear at the top of the [tool
    stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Use the sliders to adjust the sharpness:
    -   The Amount slider controls how much sharpening is done.
    -   The Radius slider controls how widely the sharpening effect is
        done around each pixel.
    -   The Threshold slider controls how different each pixel must be
        from its surrounding area before it is considered an edge pixel
        and therefore sharpened.

3.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

**Note:** It's best to be viewing your photo fully zoomed-in before
sharpening it by selecting View \> Actual Pixels.
