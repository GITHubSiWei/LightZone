you to adjust the brightness and contrast of all or parts of your photo
for any combination of the highlights, midtones, or shadows.

The ZoneMapper tool shows 16 grayscale zones each differing by 50%
brightness or half an f-stop from the next. The ZoneMapper is based on
the [Zone System](Zone_System.html).
