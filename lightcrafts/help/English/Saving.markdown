Saving your work
================

![image](images/JPEG-LZN.jpg) When you save your work, LightZone saves
your photo as a "LightZone JPEG" file. A "LightZone JPEG" file is an
ordinary JPEG file that is a preview version of your original photo but
also contains the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html) you created while
editing your photo. By default, LightZone appends `_lzn` to the file
name to indicate that it's a LightZone JPEG.

Being an ordinary JPEG file, it can be opened by any application that
works with JPEG files, be e-mailed, or displayed on the web. When
reopened with LightZone, however, the tool stack is restored and you can
resume editing where you left off. [Thumbnails](Thumbnails.html) in the
[Photo Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html) indicate LightZone JPEG files with
"JPEG-LZN" as shown above.

A LightZone JPEG still refers to your original photo (whether it's a
raw, TIFF, or another JPEG). Therefore, you should never delete your
original photo.

To save your work:
------------------

1.  Select File \> Save... or Save As...
2.  Enter a name for the file.
3.  Select a destination folder for the file.
4.  Click Save.

**Note:** Alternatively, you can save your work as "LightZone TIFF"
files by changing the [save
preference](Preferences.html#Preferences-Save).
