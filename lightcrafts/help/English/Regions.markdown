Regions and masks
=================

[1 of 10](Regions-Kinds.html)

Ordinarily, a tool affects your entire photo. Using regions to create
*masks*, you can restrict a tool's effect to just specific areas of your
photo. A mask is the set of regions for a particular tool.

Additionally, each region has an adjustable area that does feathering
thus eliminating sharp edges between where a region is and it isn't.

![image](images/Region-Control_Points.png) The *control points* of a
region determine its shape and are used to adjust it. The points are
marked by small, white circles. For example, the region shown on the
right has three control points. (There is no significance to the order.)
There is no limit to the number of control points a region may have.
