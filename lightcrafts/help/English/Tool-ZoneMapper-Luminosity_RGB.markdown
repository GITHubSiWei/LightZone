ZoneMapper: Luminosity vs. RGB
==============================

[7 of 8](Tool-ZoneMapper-Keys.html)

![image](images/Tool-ZoneMapper-Luminosity_RGB-en.png) Each pixel in a
digital photo is comprised of red, green, and blue (RGB) values. A
pixel's *luminosity* ("brightness") value is a weighted average of those
three values.

Normally, adjustments using a ZoneMapper are done using luminosity
values because there are virtually no unintended hue or saturation
changes.

However, on occasion, luminosity-based adjustments can result in
problems such as *color-clipping*. For example, if your photo has
saturated highlights such as a clear blue sky, then increasing
brightness will clip colors in portions of the sky because pixels that
are already saturated blue can't become more blue.

Adjustments using the ZoneMapper can alternatively be done using RGB
values directly to address problems such as color-clipping. For a given
photo, it's best to experiment to see which type of adjustment looks
better.
