Editing a photo
===============

Once you have found a photo you want to edit using the [Photo
Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html), you can edit it (or simply view it at
full size).

To edit a photo, do one of the following:
-----------------------------------------

1.  Double-click the thumbnail of the photo.
2.  With the photo selected, press either **enter** or **return**.
3.  Select Browser \> Edit.
4.  Control-click Right-click on the thumbnail so the pop-up menu pops
    up and select Edit.
5.  Select File \> Open... and use the file-chooser dialog to navigate
    to and select the photo you want to edit.
6.  If you have edited photos before, you can select File \> Open Recent
    and the name of the recently edited photo.

**Note:** If you have a multi-button mouse, you can alternatively
right-click to pop-up the menu rather than control-click.
