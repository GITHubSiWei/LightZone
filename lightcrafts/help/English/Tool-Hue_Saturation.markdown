Adjusting hue/saturation
========================

![image](images/Tool-Hue_Saturation-en.png) The **Hue/Saturation** tool
allows you to make color adjustments in hue, saturation, or vibrance.
All adjustments are relative.

-   **Hue**: The color of pixels.
-   **Saturation**: How vivid all colors are.
-   **Vibrance**: How vivid primary colors are.

The Vibrance slider is better than the Saturation slider when you want
to adjust only the saturation of foliage, the sky, water, clothing,
make-up (things that contain reds, greens, and blues), but leave the
saturation of skin and earth tones largely unchanged.

For example, compare the photos below.

  ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
  (a) original                                   (b) vibrance +50                               (c) saturation +50

  ---------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

In (b), the vibrance has been increased by 50 resulting in more vivid
make-up, but with the hair and background largely unchanged. In (c), the
saturation has been increased by 50 instead resulting in unnaturally
vivid colors overall.

To adjust the hue/saturation of your photo:
-------------------------------------------

1.  Click the hue/saturation tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new hue/saturation tool will appear at
    the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Use the sliders to make adjustments:

    -   The Hue slider adjusts around the wheel.
    -   The Saturation slider adjusts along the radius of the wheel from
        the center to the edge for all colors.
    -   The Vibrance slider adjusts along the radius of the wheel from
        the center to the edge, but only for the primary colors of red,
        green, and blue.

3.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.
