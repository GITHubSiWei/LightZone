Regions: Deleting
=================

If you no longer want a region, you can delete it. Note that deleting a
region does *not* delete other regions it is linked to, if any.

To delete a region:
-------------------

1.  Select the region you want to delete by clicking it. (Its contour
    will change from a solid line to a dashed line.)
2.  Select Edit \> Cut Region.
