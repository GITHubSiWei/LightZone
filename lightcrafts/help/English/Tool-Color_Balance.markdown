Adjusting color balance
=======================

![image](images/Tool-Color_Balance-en.png) The **Color Balance** tool
allows you to adjust the color balance of your photo around a specified
point of the tonal range.

Additionally, the **Color Balance** tool also allows you to reduce color
casts by selecting *neutral gray points*, that is points that you want
to be neutral gray in your photo.

Reducing color casts is most easily done for photos that were taken
under mixed lighting conditions and have easily identifiable neutral
grays.

To adjust the color balance or cast of your photo:
--------------------------------------------------

1.  Click the color balance tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new color balance tool will appear at
    the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  **To adjust the color balance:**

    1.  Click anywhere inside the color wheel. (The color balance of
        your photo will shift towards the color you clicked on.)
    2.  Use the Midpoint slider to set the midpoint of the tonal range
        of the adjustment.

    **To reduce the color cast:**

    1.  Click the eyedropper button inside the tool. (The mouse will
        change to an eyedropper.)
    2.  Click somewhere on your photo that you want to be a neutral
        gray. (Your photo's colors will shift accordingly. The color
        swatch and the Red, Green, and Blue values in the tool will also
        update.)
    3.  If you are satisfied with the color cast reduction, click the
        eyedropper button again to complete the reduction; otherwise
        repeat step (b) until you are satisfied.

3.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

**Note:** It is often useful to have multiple instances of the color
balance tool in the [tool stack](Anatomy-Tool_Stack.html) to remove
color casts from multiple areas of your photo.
