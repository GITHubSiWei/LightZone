Red-Eye reduction
=================

![image](images/Tool-Red-Eye-en.png) The **Red-Eye** tool allows you
reduce "red-eye" that sometimes occurs in photos shot using a flash.

The red-eye tool works similarly to the [Spot tool](Tool-Clone.html).
Like the Spot tool, the regions for the Red-Eye tool can not be
[inverted](Regions-Inverting.html).

To reduce red-eye in your photo:
--------------------------------

![image](images/Button-Red-Eye.png)

1.  Click the red-eye tool button in the [tool bar](Tools-Editing.html).
    (A new red-eye tool will appear at the top of the [tool
    stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Click on every eye in your photo that you want redness removed from.
    (A [region](Regions.html) will appear every time you click.)
3.  To adjust the size or shape of a region:
    1.  Double-click the region you want to adjust. (The control points
        and [inner feathering line](Regions-Feathering.html) will become
        visible.)
    2.  ![image](images/Red-Eye-Control_Points.png) Drag a control point
        or the feathering line until it's in the desired location.
    3.  When done, you can either click anywhere outside the region, or
        press either the **return** or **esc** (escape) key to complete
        the adjustments.

4.  Use the Tolerance slider to adjust how "red" pixels have to be in
    order to have their redness reduced.
