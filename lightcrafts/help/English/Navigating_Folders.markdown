Navigating folders
==================

![image](images/Folders-en.png) On the left side of the LightZone window
is the Folder Navigator that shows the folders on your computer. The
Folder Navigator looks and works much like a Finder Windows Explorer
window in list view mode.

The major difference, however, is that only folders and disks are shown
-- files are not. Instead, thumbnails for the photos in the selected
folder are displayed in the [thumbnails](Thumbnails.html) section of the
window.

The Folder Navigator allows you to navigate to, select, and view the
thumbnails and [metadata](Metadata.html) for photos in folders on your
computer.

To navigate to a folder:
------------------------

1.  Click the triangles plus signs '+' to expand the folders.
2.  Select the desired folder.

![image](images/Tools-Navigator-en.png) Additionally, the navigator tool
buttons can be used to navigate.

The **Back/Forward** buttons can be used to navigate either back or
forward to the folder you were previously in.

The **Path** button can be used to navigate up the folder tree quickly.
