Removing spots
==============

![image](images/Tool-Spot-en.png) The **Spot** tool allows you to remove
dust, scratches, blemishes, or other unwanted items from your photo.

The spot tool is a specialized version of the [Clone
tool](Tool-Clone.html). Similarly to the Clone tool, a spot is removed
by copying another part of your photo over the spot. Also like the Clone
tool, the regions for the Spot tool can not be
[inverted](Regions-Inverting.html).

To remove spots from your photo:
--------------------------------

![image](images/Button-Spot.png)

1.  Click the spot tool button in the [tool bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A
    new spot tool will appear at the top of the [tool
    stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Click on every spot in your photo that you want removed.
3.  To adjust the size or shape of a spot:
    1.  Double-click the spot you want to adjust. (The control points,
        cross-hair cursor, and [inner feathering
        line](Regions-Feathering.html) will become visible.)
    2.  ![image](images/Spot-Control_Points.png) Drag a control point,
        the cross-hair cursor, or the feathering line until it's in the
        desired location. (The cross-hair cursor designates the center
        of the area to copy from.)
    3.  When done, you can either click anywhere outside the spot, or
        press either the **return** or **esc** (escape) key to complete
        the adjustments.

**Note:** After adjusting the size of a spot, all subsequently created
spots will have the new size.
