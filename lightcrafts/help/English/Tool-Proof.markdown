Proofing
========

![image](images/Tool-Proof-en.png) The **Proof** tool allows you to see
on screen how your photo will look when [printed](Printing.html).

Unlike other tools, the proof tool is special. It is always applied to
the entire photo and can not be masked using [regions](Regions.html).
Additionally, there can be at most one proof tool, it is always placed
at the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html), and its label can not
be edited. Lastly, it is only in effect when shown.

To proof your photo:
--------------------

![image](images/Button-Proof.png)

1.  Click the proof tool button in the [tool bar](Tools-Controls.html)
    or select Tools \> Show Proof Tool. (The proof tool will appear at
    the top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Select the printer profile you will use from the Printer Profile
    pop-up menu.
3.  Select the [rendering intent](Rendering_Intent.html) you will use
    from the Rendering Intent pop-up menu.

    Your photo will now appear on screen how it will look when printed.

4.  When done, click the proof tool button again or select Tools \> Hide
    Proof Tool. (Your photo will appear as it did before and the proof
    tool will disappear from the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
