Sending photos
==============

You can send copies of selected photos to other folders using the [Photo
Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html). This is useful if you want to bundle a
set of photos into a single folder for subsequent e-mailing or uploading
to a web site as a batch.

To send the selected photos:
----------------------------

1.  ![image](images/Button-Select_Recent.png) Select one or more
    thumbnails of the photos in the browser that you want to send. (Use
    the Shift key to select multiple, contiguous thumbnails or the
    Command Control key to select multiple, non-contiguous thumbnails;
    or use the Select Recent button.)
2.  Select File \> Send...
3.  Use the Choose button to select the destination folder.
4.  Select the output size for the copied photos.
5.  Click Send (or press Return).
