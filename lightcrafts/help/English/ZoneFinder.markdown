ZoneFinder
==========

[1 of 4](Color_Selection_Viewer.html)

![image](images/ZoneFinder.png) By default when editing a photo, in the
upper-right corner of the LightZone window is the ZoneFinder that shows
a miniature version of your photo that has been segmented into 16
grayscale zones each differing by 50% brightness or half an *exposure
value* (or half an f-stop) from the next.

The ZoneFinder allows you to see where the highlights, midtones, and
shadows in your photo are in order to make adjustments using the
[ZoneMapper](Tool-ZoneMapper.html) tool.

The ZoneFinder is based on the [Zone System](Zone_System.html).
