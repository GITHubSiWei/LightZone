ZoneMapper: Adjusting the black point
=====================================

[6 of 8](Tool-ZoneMapper-Luminosity_RGB.html)

One of several adjustments you can make to your photo using the
ZoneMapper tool is the black point.

Black point adjustments are sometimes necessary for scanned positive
color film images since the density of the film is never truly black.
Additionally, there is always the possibility of having used an
incorrectly profiled scanner that might have led to a black point that
is too high.

To adjust the black point of your photo:
----------------------------------------

1.  Click the ZoneMapper tool button in the [tool
    bar](Tools-Editing.html). (A new ZoneMapper tool will appear at the
    top of the [tool stack](Tool_Stack.html).)
2.  Starting from the last zone, move the mouse upwards along the zones
    in the ZoneMapper until you find a zone that shows significant
    highlighting in the [ZoneFinder](ZoneFinder.html).
3.  Click below that zone. A *zone lock* will appear (a thin, blue line
    with a little 'X' at its right).
4.  Drag the zone lock downwards. As you do so, your photo's black point
    will decrease.

5.  Optionally:
    -   Create a mask using [regions](Regions.html).
    -   Select a different [blend mode](Blend_Modes.html).
    -   Adjust the [Opacity slider](Tool_Anatomy.html#Opacity).
    -   Make a [color/luminosity](Color_Luminosity_Selection.html)
        selection.

6.  To delete a zone lock, click the little 'X' at its right.
