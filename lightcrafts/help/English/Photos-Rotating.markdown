Rotating photos in the browser
==============================

Some digital cameras have an orientation sensor so that photos shot in
portrait mode are automatically rotated right-side-up when you look at
them. However, since some digital cameras do not have such a sensor,
photos shot in portrait mode appear sideways in the [Photo
Browser](Anatomy-Browser.html). This can be corrected by rotating them.

To rotate photos:
-----------------

1.  Select one or more thumbnails of the photos that you want to rotate.
    (Use the Shift key to select multiple, contiguous thumbnails or the
    Command Control key to select multiple, non-contiguous thumbnails.)
2.  ![image](images/Buttons-Rotate.png) Click one of rotate arrow
    buttons above the thumbnails. Alternatively, you can select Browser
    \> Rotate Left or Rotate Right.
3.  All the selected thumbnails will rotate 90 degrees in the direction
    you selected.

**Note:** Rotating either raw or TIFF files does not modify them in any
way; instead, the rotation information is stored in sidecar XMP files.
Rotating JPEG files modifies only the rotation metadata: the image data
is not modified.
